                <div class="body-m">A double pendulum is a very simple way to illustrate a chaotic system. Even though it is composed of two pendulums, whose respective motions are easily predictable, the double pendulum will never swing the same way twice.</div>
                <div class="body-m">In our installation its surprising movements are visualised, leading to glowing patterns – each one you create will be completely individual.</div>

                <div class="body-m">The line describing the motion of a pendulum’s centre of mass is called its trajectory. The theoretical description of the trajectory of a double pendulum leads to coupled nonlinear equations. Nonlinear systems generally have the property that a small change in initial conditions causes a large change in its dynamics.</div>
                <div class="body-m">Therefore, if you release the pendulum several times from almost the same position, you will get a completely different pattern each time. If all initial parameters were exactly adjustable (which is impossible in reality), the ‘chaos’ of the double pendulum could be controlled – hence we specifically call it ‘deterministic chaos’.</div>
                <div class="body-m">In our installation, an ultraviolet laser mounted on the tip of the pendulum creates an afterglow on a phosphorescent film that illuminates the path of the pendulum.</div>
